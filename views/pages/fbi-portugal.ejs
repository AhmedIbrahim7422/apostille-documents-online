            <p class="lead">Portugal has emerged as one of Europe’s most attractive destinations for American
                expats, retirees, digital nomads, and investors. With its mild climate, low cost of living, and
                welcoming immigration policies, Portugal offers an unmatched quality of life.</p>
            <p>Whether you're applying for the <strong>Golden Visa</strong>, <strong>D7 Visa</strong>, or another
                type of residency permit, you’ll need an <strong>apostilled FBI background check</strong>.
                <strong>apostilledocument.online</strong> is here to make that part of the process quick and
                hassle-free.

                <h2>Why You Need an Apostilled FBI Background Check for Portugal</h2>
                <p>To apply for long-term residency in Portugal, the Portuguese government requires a clean criminal
                    background check from your country of origin. For U.S. citizens, this means obtaining an FBI
                    background check.</p>
                <p>Crucially, this document must be <strong>apostilled by the U.S. Department of State</strong> to
                    be legally accepted in Portugal under the terms of the Hague Apostille Convention. This is a
                    critical document for your visa application, and delays or errors can cause major setbacks.
