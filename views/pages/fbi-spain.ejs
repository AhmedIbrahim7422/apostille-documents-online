        <h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span> Why Spain Requires an Apostilled FBI Background Check</h2>
        <p>If you are a U.S. citizen applying for any long-stay visa in Spain, you must prove your criminal record status. While the FBI background check (also known as an Identity History Summary or IdHS) provides this history, Spanish consulates have no way of knowing if the document is real.</p>
        <p>This is where the apostille comes in. As a member of the Hague Apostille Convention, Spain legally requires an apostille to <strong>authenticate U.S. federal documents</strong>. The apostille, issued by the U.S. Department of State, certifies that your FBI report is a genuine and official document, making it legally valid for use in Spain.</p>
        <p>Attempting to navigate this complex federal process alone, especially while managing other visa paperwork, can lead to critical errors, missed deadlines, or rejections. Using a dedicated service like <strong><a href="/">fbiexpress.com</a></strong> is the most reliable way to get it done right the first time.</p>
