            <p class="lead">Planning to move to Spain for work, study, or residency? One of the most critical
                documents for your visa application is an <strong>apostilled FBI background check</strong>. Spanish
                authorities require this certified document to verify your criminal record, and it must be
                authenticated by the U.S. Department of State to be legally accepted.</p>
            <p>The process may sound complex, but with <strong>apostilledocument.online</strong>, it's simple. We specialize
                in providing an <strong>expedited FBI apostille service for Spain</strong>, helping thousands of
                clients get their documents quickly, securely, and correctly.</p>

                <h2>Why is an FBI Background Check Apostille Required for Spain?</h2>
                <p>Spanish consulates must verify that you have no serious criminal record in your home country. An
                    FBI background check (also known as an Identity History Summary) provides this, but Spain, as a
                    member of the Hague Apostille Convention, will only accept it if it has an official
                    <strong>apostille</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>The apostille is the international authentication that certifies your FBI report is a legitimate
                    U.S. government document. Submitting your background check *without* an apostille will lead to
                    significant delays or a flat-out rejection of your <strong>Spain visa application</strong>,
                    whether it's for a non-lucrative, student, or work visa.</p>
